## Android Template Project


**Thanks to [refreshVersions](https://github.com/jmfayard/refreshVersions)** all the most used dependencies are already included and keep updated.


Beside "buildSrc" (and dependencies.kt) became almost useless! It's still present for:
- Double choise to add module _dependencies{}_ such as implementation/testimplementation/api
- Still be able to use yours shortcut for blocks like _plugins { id or kapt }_ or _android { defaultConfig{} }_
